# Movie Recommendation System using Content-based and Collaborative Filtering

This project focuses on exploring two methods for movie recommendation systems: Content-based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. The benefits of recommendation systems include increased sales/conversion and user satisfaction. We used the MovieLens dataset to train and test our models, and utilized techniques such as SVD, KNN, and Content-based Filtering. We analyzed the dataset, compared the benefits and limitations of each method, and present a detailed report of our findings.
